  <p>
    The Great Architect Peter Zumthor's quote above depicts the notion of careful design & place making.
  </p>
  <p>
    NIK AMIRUL FAIZ ARCHITECT believes that putting things in its rightful built-environment as a giant unsolved puzzle
    board. The puzzle pieces represents each components of the built environment. These 'pieces' vary from time to time;
    some fit perfectly fine with each other whilst others don't, making the 'puzzle board' almost impossible to be
    completed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our visioin is therefore to create the 'missing piece' that fits in the rightful place & time of each problem to the
    missing puzzle; with the aim to complete the 'puzzle board' & achieve a pleasant image that meets the eye. In other
    words, create a pleasant environment that meets the needs.
  </p>
  <p>
    The above intent is resonated in our logo design, depicting a puzzle piece to reflect that image.
  </p>
  <p>
    By approaching each project as a making of each & every unique 'piece', our hope is we can contribute to the built
    environment by creating each 'piece' of architecture that fits into the right place & timeless in nature. Target:
    to complete the unsolved 'puzzle board';
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Once piece at a time.</strong>
