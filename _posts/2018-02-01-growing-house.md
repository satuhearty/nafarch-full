        The client’s brief is simple. To build with current needs, but with the design consideration for future 
        expansion to cater for mul-generation living. As land cost increases by the day, eventually owning a land will 
        become unaffordable to many. Thus the idea that a single land can cater for a house that is ‘growing’ with time 
        and space plays a vital role.
