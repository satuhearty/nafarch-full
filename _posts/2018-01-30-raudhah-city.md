        This masterplan proposal targets to develop a community revolved around education. With Brainy Bunch 
        International School being the catalyst, the idea is that the Brainy Bunch community could live in close 
        proximity with the education hub, also live & interact in their businesses & daily lives within the community 
        framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        The city plan is based on 4S concept : shariah compliant city, safe city, smart city & sustainable city.
