        Located in Marang, Terengganu, this client had a specific brief of home retreat to cater for extended family
        living. And it so happens to be that their interest also revolves around the Malay traditional house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking the above factors into account, we proposed to adapt the Terengganu Traditional house typology, but fuse
        it with modern day needs & requirements. The design outcome is somehwat unique. Combining traditional finishes
        with modern building construction material, this project hopes to achieve both the brief & interest of the
        client.

      <p>
        When first approaching the design, the thought has always been revolving around the roots of what traditional
        Malay architecture house is all about, the culture.
      </p>
      <p>
        By delving into the Terengganu Malay culture that influences certain architectural features of the Terengganu
        Malay house, we were able to reinterpret the form & functionalities in the modern context through the planning
        of the house layout, as well as in the form making of the building.
      </p>
      <p>
        The resultant effect is 3 traditional house modules arranged to fomr a holistic function as a house for extended
        family living gateway. The in-between spaces between the modules are what stitches them together, invoking
        interesting interior outcomes.
