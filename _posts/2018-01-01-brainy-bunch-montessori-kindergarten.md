        Brainy Bunch has gotten a long way since its early years in 2010. They have expanded throughout Malaysia & had
        been operating mainly in shoplots & rented bungalows. Starting 2018 onwards, they plan to build purpose built
        montessori kindergarten that is in-line with the Montessori's principles whereby emphasis on the outside
        environment is crucial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Located in Ampang, this project aims to be the pilot project; targeting it to be the signature design for all
        their future kindergarten in Malaysia.

        "Education is a natural process carried out by the human individual, and is not acquired by listening to words,
        but by experiences in the environment."
        <br />
        - Dr. Maria Montessori

      <p>
        Montessori teaching is all about practical learning and influenced by the environment it is established.
        Therefore the main aim of the project is to maximize internal occupants but at the same time encourage outdoor
        learning to the maximum usage. Thus the idea of each levels having access to outdoor spaces for activities
        facilitates the intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        A montessori school also promotes respect towards the people & environment in its learning process. This is
        further enhanced by maximizing the green landscaping at all the open spaces introduced; providing natural
        shading as well as cools the temperature of the space, suited to our equitorial tropical climat conditions.
